{title:Take me home}
{artist:Phil Collins}

Take that look of worry
Im an ordinary man
They dont tell me nothing
So I find out all I can
Theres a fire thats been burning
Right outside my door
I cant see but I feel it
And it helps to keep me warm
So i, I dont mind
No i, I dont mind

Seems so long Iv e been waiting
Still dont know what for
Theres no point escaping
I dont worry anymore
I cant come out to find you
I dont like to go outside
They cant turn off my feelings
Like they're turning off a light
But i, I dont mind
No i, I dont mind
Oh i, I dont mind
No i, I dont mind

So take, take me home
Cos I dont remember
Take, take me home
Cos I dont remember
Take, take me home
Cos I dont remember
Take, take me home, oh lord
Cos Ive been a prisoner all my life
And I can say to you
Take  that look of worry, mines an ordinary life
Working when its daylight
And sleeping when its night
Ive got no far horizons
I dont wish upon a star
They dont think that I listen
Oh but I know who they are

And i, I  dont mind
No i, I dont mind
Oh i, I dont mind
No i, I dont mind

So take, take me home
Cos I dont remember
Take, take me home
Cos I dont remember
Take, take me home
Cos I dont remember
Take, take me home, oh lord
Well Ive been a prisoner all my life
And I can say to you
But I dont remember
Take, take me home...
