{title:Sick of losing soulmates}
{artist:Dodie}

What a strange being you are
God knows where I would be
If you hadn't found me
Sitting all alone in the dark

A dumb screenshot of youth
Watch how a cold broken teen
Will desperately lean on a superglued human of proof

What the hell would I be
Without you

Brave face talk so lightly
Hide the truth
{soc}
Now I'm sick of losing soul mates
So where do we begin
I can finally see
You're as fucked up as me
So how do we win
{eoc}
Yeah I'm sick of losing soul mates
Won't be alone again
I can finally see
You're as fucked up as me
So how do we win

We will grow old as friends
I've promised that before
So whatâ€™s one more?

In our grey haired circle waiting for the end

Time and hearts will wear us thin
So which path will you take
Cause we both know a break
Does exactly what  it says on the tin

What the hell would I be
Without you

Brave face talk so lightly
Hide the truth
{soc}
Now i'm sick of losing soul mates
So where do we begin
I can finally see
You're as fucked up as me
So how do we win
{eoc}
Yeah i'm sick of losing soul mates
Won't be alone again
I can  finally see
You're as fucked up as me
So how do we win

I won't take no for an answer
I won't take no for an answer
I won't take no
I won't take no
