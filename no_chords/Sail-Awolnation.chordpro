This is how I show my love
I made it in my mind because
I blame it on my A.D.D. baby
This is how an angel cries
I blame it on my own sick pride
Blame it on my A.D.D baby

Sail, sail, sail, sail, sail, sail

I look in the mirror and nothing is familiar right there
I look in the mirror and nothing is familiar I dare
For you to say that
You familiar with character w ishes I have
Mental is right and they p ick yellow cab
Telling the driver to  press on the gas
Yell at em till I get there
You can just love me o r leave me alone
I'm warning you though
If you love me you'll never go wrong
We can explore every feeling
Of breathing mother natures air
Feeling of knowing that I'm r ight or rare
But theres a reason
For all of my manners
The gladdest I am that you here

Sail, sail, sail, sail, sail, sail

This is how I show my love
Let my soul sail before I’m washed up
Gotta drop down thank God above
That I’m high enough
To give the sky a touch
Maybe its my ADD
I’m on the move like a real estate agency Century 21
The 21st Century bare
The birth of my history there can only be one
This how I show my love
Let my soul sound like This ain't equal
Sacrifice my life just to free the people the Jesus sequel
So many admirers
Cause they cant see
Through our iris’s
I got an ey e for her
I got an eye for her
I got Three eyes
I need three brides

Sail, sail, sail, sail, sail, sail
