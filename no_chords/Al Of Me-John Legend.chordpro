{title:Al Of Me}
{artist:John Legend}

What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out.
You've got my head spinning, no kidding.  I can't pin you down.
What's going on in that beautiful mind?  I'm on your magical mystery ride.
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me,  but I'll be alright.
My head's under water,  but I'm breathing fine.  You're crazy and I'm out of  my mind.
{soc}
Cause all of me, loves all of you.  Love your curves and all your edges.
All your perfect imperfections.  Give your all to me.  I'll give my all to you.
You're my end and my beginning.  Even when I lose I'm winning.
Cause I give you all , all of me,  and you give  me all , all of you.
How many times do I have to tell you,  even when you're crying you're beautiful too.
The world is beating you down.  I'm around through every mood.
You're my downfall, you're my muse.  My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues.
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you.

Even when I lose I'm winning.  Cause I give you all of me,
And you give me all of you.
{eoc}
Give me all of you.  Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts.  Risking it  all, though it's hard.
